## Group Work

### Case Description
After poperly analising the features of ROSE robot (a social robot designed to support healthcare settings), we have categorised them as [View Features Image](Features.jpg) Then our group explored three application ideas for ROSE [View Application Image](Applications.jpg), particularly for elderly care and hospitals. The goal was to create meaningful value through companionship, cognitive stimulation, emotional connection, and assistance in daily tasks.

**Idea 1: Entertainment Robot for Children in Waiting Rooms**  
ROSE serves as a playful companion to entertain children while their guardians attend medical appointments. It adapts games based on the number and age of participants and uses cartoon-like voices and animations to remain engaging.

**Idea 2: Retro Companion for Dementia Care**  
ROSE acts as a retro-styled companion for elderly patients with Alzheimer’s or dementia. It interacts in a 60s/70s tone, plays familiar music for memory recall, and provides basic expressions. In case of emergency, it can alert trusted contacts.

**Idea 3: Autonomous Delivery Robot in Healthcare**  
ROSE functions as an autonomous logistics assistant, capable of safely transporting items such as medication or samples between different locations. It requires safe storage, navigation tools, gripping mechanisms, and monitoring for safe handling.

## Requirements  

**Idea 1 (Children’s Robot)**  
- Visually engaging and suitable for children  
- Uses entertaining dialogues and cartoon-style speech  
- Games can be adjusted based on age and group size  

**Idea 2 (Dementia Care)**  
- Calming voice using retro speech style  
- Basic facial expressions for emotional comfort  
- Familiar regional personality tone  
- Emergency alert capability  

**Idea 3 (Logistics Robot)**  
- Safe handling of items  
- Storage and gripping capabilities  
- Ability to deliver without human help

## Reflections

### How is Design Research linked to HRI
-  Chapter 8 explains that we should design robots together with users, not just by ourselves. It says to build simple versions early then test them with people, and learn from real life. It also highlights that social robot design should be user-centered, iterative, and open-source, with real-world feedback shaping the development. 
-  In Chapter 9 itis clear that physical bodies are optional. Users form emotional bonds through behavior, communication, and emotional intelligence rather than mechanical embodiment.
-  After watching the trailer of Her movie, I understand that  emotional connection is possible without a body, confirming that behavioral and emotional presence is more important than physical form.
-  From the given textbook, Vincent predicted that we would bond with smart devices and Bar-Cohen thought we would live with humanoid robots. In real life, Vincent predictions are currently in action as we got smart phones and voice assistants. But in near future the world is advancing to live with humanoid robots.
-  The robot hotel tried to replace all staff with robots, but they often failed when guests needed help. CitizenM used robots smartly and kept people around for real support.
-  Nabaztag was a cute robot that could move and talk a little. But it lacked deep emotional interaction and adaptability, so users lost interest quickly.
-  CuddleBits taught that small movements like soft shaking triggered strong emotional responses and can make people feel connected. Simple, kind behavior matters more than looking fancy and complex design.
-  I haven't watched 'Be Right Back' (Black Mirror) but after reading about it, its evident that robots can help people but cannot fully replace real humans.
