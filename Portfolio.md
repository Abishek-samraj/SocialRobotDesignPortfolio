## Reflections

### How is Design Research linked to HRI
-  Chapter 8 explains that we should design robots together with users, not just by ourselves. It says to build simple versions early then test them with people, and learn from real life. It also highlights that social robot design should be user-centered, iterative, and open-source, with real-world feedback shaping the development. 
-  In Chapter 9 itis clear that physical bodies are optional. Users form emotional bonds through behavior, communication, and emotional intelligence rather than mechanical embodiment.
-  After watching the trailer of Her movie, I understand that  emotional connection is possible without a body, confirming that behavioral and emotional presence is more important than physical form.
-  From the given textbook, Vincent predicted that we would bond with smart devices and Bar-Cohen thought we would live with humanoid robots. In real life, Vincent predictions are currently in action as we got smart phones and voice assistants. But in near future the world is advancing to live with humanoid robots.
-  The robot hotel tried to replace all staff with robots, but they often failed when guests needed help. CitizenM used robots smartly and kept people around for real support.
-  Nabaztag was a cute robot that could move and talk a little. But it lacked deep emotional interaction and adaptability, so users lost interest quickly.
-  CuddleBits taught that small movements like soft shaking triggered strong emotional responses and can make people feel connected. Simple, kind behavior matters more than looking fancy and complex design.
-  I haven't watched 'Be Right Back' (Black Mirror) but after reading about it, its evident that robots can help people but cannot fully replace real humans.
